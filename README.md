- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt Jones @Matt-Jones-Developer.  I am passionate about becoming a full-time software engineer or website developer. 
-     Currently living in the UK but I love to travel too... remote working is the future!
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering, web design and both front-end and back-end development.  
-     I love coding, problem solving, retro gaming and playing Thrash Metal on my guitar!
-     I am from a creative background, have good experience in music production, 2D animation, game design and vector illustration.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, JavaScript, advanced CSS and SCSS.  I am currently enrolled in Harvard's CS50, edX's Front-End Web Developer courses.

- 💞️ I’m looking for a junior role within a fantastic organisation who I can design and create exciting software, websites and web apps with.
