- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt Jones...  I am passionate about coding, design, and building cool projects. I am currently living in the UK but I love to travel too... remote working is the future!
- 👀 I’m interested in eventually becoming a C++ software engineer, but I'm really enjoying UI and web design, both front-end and back-end development.  
-     I love coding, problem solving, retro gaming and playing Thrash Metal on my guitar!
-     I am from a creative background, have good experience in music production, 2D animation, game design and vector illustration.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, JavaScript, advanced CSS and SCSS.  I am currently enrolled in Harvard's CS50, edX's Front-End Web Developer courses.

- 💞️ I’m looking for freelance opportunites to build amazing things for people, or a role within a fantastic organisation who I can design and create exciting websites and web apps with.
-     I am also interested in collaborating on projects through GitHub to help further our skills and experience, so please do get in touch.
    
- 📫 How to reach me ... email: glitchyghost81@protonmail.com
